// CefThread
//
// This class represents a thread that is known by a browser-wide name.  For
// example, there is one IO thread for the entire browser process, and various
// pieces of code find it useful to retrieve a pointer to the IO thread's
// Invoke a task by thread ID:
//
//   CefThread::PostTask(CefThread::IO, FROM_HERE, task);
//
// The return value is false if the task couldn't be posted because the target
// thread doesn't exist.  If this could lead to data loss, you need to check the
// result and restructure the code to ensure it doesn't occur.
//
// This class automatically handles the lifetime of different threads.
// It's always safe to call PostTask on any thread.  If it's not yet created,
// the task is deleted.  There are no race conditions.  If the thread that the
// task is posted to is guaranteed to outlive the current thread, then no locks
// are used.  You should never need to cache pointers to MessageLoops, since
// they're not thread safe.
