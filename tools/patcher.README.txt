Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) Patch Application Tool -- patcher.py
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Document Last Updated: July 23, 2009


OVERVIEW
--------

The CEF patch application tool is used by the patch project to apply patches
to the Chromium and WebKit code bases. Currently only unified diff format is
supported. See the README.txt file in the patch directory for information on
how the patch project uses this tool.

The 'patcher.bat' file can be used to run the patch application tool with
command-line arguments that match the default CEF directory structure and
output options. Run 'patcher.py -h' for a complete list of available command-
line arguments.
