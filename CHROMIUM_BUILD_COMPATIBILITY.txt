The Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) project is built on top of the Chromium
project source tree.  Because of the Chromium project's constant state of flux
certain revisions of the CEF project may not be compatible with all Chromium
revisions, and visa-versa. This document tracks the combination of CEF
revision and Chromium revision that have been officially tested by the CEF
development team.
